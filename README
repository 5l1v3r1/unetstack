Userspace network stack.

This is an extremely small network stack implementation, which works on top of new netchannels interface [1].
It was used as a base for Linux 2.6 netchannels alternative TCP/IP stack implementation 
which was proven to be faster than existing Linux socket code.

Project is being actively developed, so there are no stable API, documentation 
or some other interesting things. For usage examples please see main() function
in packet.c file.

Supported features:

    * TCP/UDP sending and receiving.
    * Timestamp, window scaling, MSS TCP options.
    * PAWS.
    * Slow start and congestion control.
    * Route table (including startic ARP cache).
    * Socket-like interface.
    * IP processing code.
    * complete retransmit algorithm.
    * fast retransmit support.
    * data split to MSS sized chunks.
    * correct recv processing for bulk sending (although can stuck, which requires some tuning).
    * support for TCP listen state (only point-to-point mode, i.e. no new data channels are created, 
	when new client is connected, instead state is changed according to protocol 
	(TCP state is changed to ESTABLISHED).
